# FootCapture: AR-Based Guidance System for Photogrammetry in Medical Foot Wound Monitoring

## Introduction
FootCapture is a mobile application designed to facilitate the easy acquisition of precise photographic measurements for foot wound care. Utilizing augmented reality technology, it guides untrained users to capture comprehensive photographic data from the correct positions and angles, suitable for creating high-fidelity photogrammetry 3D models of the patient’s foot.

## Features
- **AR-Guided Imaging**: Intuitive AR interface for guiding the image capture process.
- **Photogrammetry 3D Modeling**: Employs photogrammetry to create detailed 3D models of foot wounds.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Designed for ease of use, enabling caregivers to quickly generate models without prior training.
- **Compatibility**: Optimized for iPhones, especially those equipped with LiDAR sensors for enhanced depth map integration.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Application Installation**: Install the application on a compatible iPhone, using XCode.
2. **Scanning Process**: Use the app to scan the patient's foot, following the on-screen AR dome guidance.
3. **Image Exportation**: Export the captured images and depth maps to a laptop or server for rendering.
4. **3D Model Rendering**: Use the Apple Object Capture API or similar tools to render the 3D model from the captured images.
